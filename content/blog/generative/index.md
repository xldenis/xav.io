title: Generative Art
draft: true

_I've decided to teach myself generative art, and to more generally work on visual and audio artworks throughout the year. To that end I want to create one "piece" a week, more akin to a sketch, both to practice skills and techniques as well as to try out some ideas._

# Week of Jan 28th

I saw a mural a few months ago that I found interesting. It's simply a few large shapes painted on a wall but done in such a manner that it almost looks like a 20m high watercolor. So I'm going to try and create a generator for works in the same style.

I've decided to use p5.js from purescript so that I can eventually host finished generators. Maybe I'll switch to vanilla javascript at some point but not right now at least :)

I worked a little more on the paint effect, fixed a few purescript performance pitfalls, and got something more interesting. For the next week I'd like to focus on reusing this technique in an actual composition. I was thinking of using this to procedurally paint shapes. For the next week I'll focus on randomly generating the compositions and figuring out a technique to actually apply this brush template to them in an interesting manner.
