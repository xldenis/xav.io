I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [ETH](https://ethz.ch) Zurich](https://ethz.ch) in the [programming methodology group](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/about-us.html) where I work on the performance and methodology of formal verification.

Previously I was a PhD student at the [LMF](https://lms.cnrs.fr) where I developed [Creusot](https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot), a state-of-the-art verifier for Rust based on translation to *pure*, *functional* programs.
Using Creusot, I explored how to push the scale and efficiency of verification, leading to the development of [CreuSAT](https://github.com/sarsko/creusat) a verified, high-performance SAT solver, and [Sprout](https://github.com/xldenis/cdsat) a verified SMT solver.
Using Creusot, we [developed](https://jhjourdan.mketjh.fr/pdf/denis2023iterators.pdf) an ergonomic methodology for verifying iterator-based code in first-order logic, including higher-order functions with side-effects like `map`.

In my previous life, I was a production engineer at Shopify, where I helped transition the core platform from to a novel sharded architecture, resilient to datacenter failures.
