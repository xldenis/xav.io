        <p>For the past week I’ve been going through a phase of tech-debt cleannup in Ill. One of the objectives is to come up with a unified type for compiler phases. Most phases already have a type along the lines of <code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="dt">Module</span> a_i <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Either</span> e_i (<span class="dt">Module</span> a_i<span class="fu">+</span><span class="dv">1</span>)</code>. The problem was the error type at each phase either had to be shared by <em>all</em> phases leading to an unwiedly sum <em>or</em> I had to unpack it between each phase.</p>
<p>A long time ago I read a <a href="https://gist.github.com/chrisdone/fd6c6f6a8c5b5d4d3c3f91289343629f">couple</a> <a href="https://github.com/jaspervdj/talks/blob/master/2017-skillsmatter-errors/slides.md#which-is-the-best-representation-2">great</a> posts on errors which presented a solution to this problem. They sat on the backburner while there were more important things to work on, but now I’ve decided to entirely overhaul the error handling as part of that. 2</p>
<p>I adopted Jasper’s <code>Error</code> datatype, making that the shape of errors between subsystems. Internally, I’ll use sum types to keep context about every error and then render it into a <code>Error</code> type at the subsystem boundary.</p>
<p>Starting with: <img src="../../images/old-errors.png" /></p>
<p>The goal is to end with something like: <img src="../../images/new-errors.png" /></p>
<p>I won’t pretend to be an expert in error message design, but it’s clear that the first image leaves a lot to be desired. For this error refactoring, I had a couple goals in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to easily understand <em>what</em> the error was. This meant a clear title, the previous errors would often bury the actual message under 20 lines of location context.</li>
<li>I wanted access to all the information on <em>how</em> to resolve the error. Often, this is just returning more of the context at the site of the error: which constraints were missing, which terms failed to unify, etc…</li>
<li>If possible provide context for users. This isn’t really for me but for the <del>friends</del> unfortunate bystanders I coerce into writing example programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>TODO</p>
